    # Assertions are for development, not the final product. By the time I

        # and not require the sanity checks.

'''
    DEBUG  logging.debug()
    The lowest level. Used for small details.
    Usually you care about these messages only when diagnosing problems.
    
    INFO   logging.info()
    Used to record information on general events
    in your program or confirm that things are working at their point in the
    program.
    
    WARNING logging.warning()
    Used to indicate a potential problem that
    doesnâ€™t prevent the program from working but might do so in the future.
    
    ERROR logging.error() Used to record an error that caused the
    program to fail to do something.
    
    CRITICAL logging.critical() The highest level. Used to indicate a fatal
    error that has caused or is about to cause the program to stop running
    entirely.
                                                                             '''
